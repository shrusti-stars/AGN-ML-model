This project applies machine learning models to predict AGN occurrences based on host galaxy properties, as an extension of the analysis presented in Janssen et al. (2012): "The Triggering Probability of Radio-Loud AGN: A Comparison of High and Low Excitation Radio Galaxies in Hosts of Different Colors".  

### Objective:
The machine learning model classifies AGNs into two categories based on their excitation types: High-Excitation Radio Galaxies (HERGs) and Low-Excitation Radio Galaxies (LERGs). The goal is to understand how different AGN types are influenced by host galaxy properties and their environments.


ML model is designed to classify AGNs based on their excitation (high-excitation vs. low-excitation) and link this to host galaxy properties. This would help to understand how different AGN types affect their host galaxies and environments differently.  
Model Type: A classification model (Random Forest).  
Features: may use host galaxy features (like color, mass, etc,.) and AGN features (radio luminosity, optical emission lines, etc.) as inputs to predict the AGN type.

Evaluation Metrics:  
For classification model (HERG vs. LERG classification): we use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC to assess the modelâ€™s performance.

Once we have trained our ML model, we can analyze:
How AGN characteristics (radio luminosity, emission lines, etc.) relate to feedback mechanisms.
